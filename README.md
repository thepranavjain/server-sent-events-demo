# A simple demo of server sent events

This demo generates a random number every second and sends it to the client using server sent events.

## Running the demo

1. Run `npm install` in the `server` directory to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` in the `server` directory to start the server. Or alternatively `npm run dev` to start the server with hot reloading for development.
3. Open the `client/index.html` file in your browser to see the demo.
